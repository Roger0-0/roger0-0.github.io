I know there are some people who despise this book, but I think it just comes down to whether or not you can sympathize/empathize with Holden.<br/><br/>Having dealt with depression around the same age as Holden, and having had similar self destructive thoughts as him I have a hard time getting through this book with dry eyes.That's not to say the book is overtly sad or depressing, in fact it's very funny at times.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people criticize Holden as a whiny annoying teenager, but that's kinda the whole point. He literally can't enjoy anything, and people who have suffered from depression can relate to that.<br/><br/>In my opinion the book is about Holden's battle with depression and how he learned to deal with it. I think the most important chapter is when he goes to meet Mr Antolini. He kind of gives Holden the right advice when he basically tells him to stop moralizing so much. At the end of the day that's Holden's problem he constantly judges and moralizes everyone and everything in the book and that's the driving force of his depression. It's not until the end when he is able to just enjoy watching Phoebe ride on the carousel that he actually learns this lesson.<br/><br/>I know this tends to be a love it or hate it type book, but I fricken love it to death. Still my favorite fiction book as of February 16 2022.",,,1,0
